# Graph Theory

### Project 2018

This repository contains code written in the programming language Go.

Author: Keith Daly.

Innitiated: March 2018.

Student @GMIT, Galway, Ireland. 

Year three - Semester two.

## Problem Statement

You must write a program in the Go programming language that can
build a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) from a regular expression,
and can use the NFA to check if the regular expression matches any given
string of text.
